CLARITY:

SOLID PRINCIPLES USED:
SRP: all the components responsible for angular's components are separate as well as the services, they are all separate and NON of them overlap (otherwise angular throws a fit)
Open close principle: what do i even write here?
Liskov substitution: no instance of inheritance of stuff that is not needed
interface segregation: no overlapping interfaces or abstract classes
dependency inversion: no attributes which needed to be generalized or can be generalised

srp components and services:
components:
Welcome (responsible for the initial clarity title screen)
Layout (responsible for routing and logout button along with buttons for navigation)
Dashboard (initial screen)
Project (displays the projects list and selection, deletion and creation)
project details (handles displaying grid and and screen elements)
analytics (ai analysed analytics (bilal did that))
tasks (simplified view of viewing to-do-list scheduled-tasks)
settings (screen used for ip to the backend server, Oauth settings, notifcations and everything)
ai-insight (displays basic statisctical analysis of ur task completions)
ai-assistant (ai agent that is also used to invite people,get task suggestions and get detailed analysis of task completion)
 
services:
socket-service (very useful, used to communicate with the backend server using socket.io)
google-integration-service (used to send api calls to google services login,calender, and contacts)
data-service (saving projects on the machine of the server (uses socket-service to send the project data to the backend))
auth-service (used to obtain the Oauth token generated by the google-integration-service)
ai-service (communicates with the gemini api)
analytics-service (backend maths of the analytics screen)

design models:
Singleton (all the components and services only have one instance)
Factory (the object-builder class acts as a factory as its used to create and reconstruct objects after sending/receiving through socket.io)
observer (socket-service consists of listeners for each update which is used to immediately update on the network without reloading the project,grid screens)
adaptor (the tojson() functions convert of the screen element objects to javascript objects that are sent/received bw the server and frontend)
	(the images and videos also consist of their data in the form of bits which is recreated on the frontend as u cant really "load" them on the frontend, it needs paths)
